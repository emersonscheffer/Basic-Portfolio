                    My name is Emerson. I like to create concepts. I live in San Pablo - CA with my wife and my two
                    kids. I
                    always liked technology and loved to learn how things work. In 2009 I went to school for aviation
                    and
                    got my
                    private pilot license. A year later I got my commercial pilot license, but I never worked in the
                    aviation field.

                    I started working with computer graphics when I was 17. My first job was designing custom business
                    cards using photoshop. Over the years, I worked with an array of tools like Corel Draw,
                    Illustrator,
                    Photoshop, Flash, QuarkXPress, Maya, Dreamweaver and others.

                    My work portfoliio includes frontend websites, 3d modeling, video and audio editing, and brochures.
                    I
                    always had good mentors/friends who helped me to accomplish the job.
